# An-Array-Heavy-App
Clue:: All is one and One is all

[6/9/15]- In this app, I will be using at least 4 extensive arrays, possibly 8 with a maximum of 9.
        
        - Negative values will be implemented either halfway or three-quarters of the way into the project to produce inverse results. This is likely to be the last cornerstone to be secured into place.
        - Eventual GUI will be developed, but will only begin after base framework is completed.
        - This project will attempt to consolidate languages towards C-compatibility.
        - Relatively simple in concept and fairely straightfoward in organization, this project should not take any longer than a month of occasional arbitrary leisure time to complete.
        - Additional cornerstone to app will also heavily consist of random number generator.
        - The arrays will be split and quarantined into two separate groups for most accurate results.
        - Before initiating the program's main purpose, the user will be given a list of patterns to choose from upon which to display results.
